# SO_TabLayoutDemo

Android Tab Layout is basically a view class required to be added into the layout of our app to create sliding tabs. 

However, you can create sliding as well as non-sliding tabs by using Android tablayout. If you want to add Android tabs without sliding, then replace the layout with the fragment on tab selected listener event. And, if you want to add sliding tabs, then use ViewPager.

Here, weâ€™ve created a tutorial on [How to Create Multiple Tabs In a Single Screen Using Android Tab Layout](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/create-multiple-tabs-using-android-tab-layout/).

If you want to implement this feature in your Android app and looking to Hire [Android App Development Company](http://www.spaceotechnologies.com/android-app-development/) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
